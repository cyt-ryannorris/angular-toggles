Toggles - A great way to deploy code without features
===

I really like Martin Fowler's [Feature Toggle](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html) paradigm and have done some significant work making it real for Grails developers in the past.  Here's my stab at it for Angularjs.

Damn, it's a sweet directive!

Yessir.  Add it anywhere that you want to shut things off.  You'll need two things: add the directive to your markup...

    <div toggle feature="cool_new_feature">...</div>

And make sure there's some way to tell the directive that the feature is on or off.  This requires you to configure a factory called 'Endpoints.  Here's an example:

    angular.module('togglesTestApp.services', []).factory('Endpoints', function() {
        return {
          togglesConfigUrl: '/toggles.json'
        };
    });

What you configure your togglesConfigUrl is your business.  It can be something that is generated by some backend RESTful service or a static JSON file.  It just needs to be a map of feature names and whether or not they are enabled.  All features toggled by this directive are enabled by default.

Example:

    {
      'cool_new_feature': true,
      'myExperimentalFeature': false
    }

Bower to the rescue!

    bower install --save-dev angular-toggles
